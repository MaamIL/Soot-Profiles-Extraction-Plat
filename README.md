# Soot-Profiles-Extraction-Plat
A general platform for creating datasets and running various deep learning models on it for research of extracting soot profiles out of a flame image. Built for Dr. Victor Chernov, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Braude College.
As I'm working for a researcher, changes are done often. The generelization idea is to switch between models and input/output properties easily and fast.
